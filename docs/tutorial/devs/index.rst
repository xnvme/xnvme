Linux Dev. Environment
======================

This shows the manual steps of setting up a physical machine for **xNVMe** test
and development. This includes using devices attached to the machine, as well
as using the physical machine to setup virtual machines with advanced
NVMe-device emulation.

Advanced NVMe device emulation covers command-set enchancements such as
Flexible Data-Placement (FDP), Zoned Namespaces (ZNS), and Key-Value SSDs (KV).

The documentation is provided as a means to setup development environment with
minimal fuss and maximum foss :)

Physical Machine
----------------

It is assumed that you have a physisical machine with NVMe storage available,
and that you can utilize it destructively. That is, that any data can and will
be lost when using the NVMe devices for testing.

Qemu is utilized extensively during testing to verify NVMe functionality of
NVM, ZNS, KV, FDP, etc. that is NVMe features not readiliy available in HW
is emulated via qemu. Thus, a physical machine is attractive reduce build and
runtime.

It is of course possible to do nested-virtualization, however, it is often
impractical as I/O get orders of magnitudes slower which less than ideal during
build.

Most machines will do for common development and testing, throughout a machine
with the following traits are used:

* An x86 64-bit CPU

* At least 8GB of memory

* A SATA SSD, 100GB will suffice, used for the

  * Operating system
  * User data (``$HOME``), repositories, workdirs, etc.

* One or more NVMe SSDs

  * Utilized for testing

This physical machine will be referred to as ``box01``.

.. tip::
   Since, the devices utilized for testing a primarily NVMe devices, then it is
   convenient to have the operating system and user-data installed on a
   separate non-NVMe device, quite simply since SATA pops up as ``/dev/sd*``
   and NVMe as ``/dev/nvme*`` / ``/dev/ng*``. It avoids one accidentally wiping
   the OS device when the devices are entirely separate.


.. _sec-tutorials-devs-linux-os:

Operating System
----------------

Here, the latest **stable** Debian Linux, currently **bookworm** is used
throughout.

* Install it

  * Un-select desktop environment

  * Select OpenSSH

* Add user ``odus`` with password as you see fit
* Partition using the entire device

* Setup networking

And make sure it is accessible from your "main" development machine:

.. code-block:: bash

  ssh-copy-id odus@box01

Log into the machine:

.. code-block:: bash

  ssh odus@box01

And then install a couple of things:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Switch to root
  su -
  apt-get -qy update && apt-get -qy install \
    git \
    htop \
    screen \
    pipx \
    sudo \
    vim

  # Make sure that cli-tools installed with pipx are available
  pipx ensurepath

  # Add odus to sudoers (required to do various things as non-root)
  usermod -aG sudo odus

  # Add odus to kvm (required to run qemu as non-root)
  usermod -aG kvm odus

  # switch back out of root
  exit

  # log out of odus
  exit

.. tip::
   Log out and back in again, to refresh credentials

Additionally, in order to prepare the system for user-space NVMe drivers, then
vfio/iommu should be enabled along with a couple of user-limit tweaks.

Have a look at the :ref:`sec-backends-spdk-config` section for the details on
this.

.. _sec-tutorials-devs-linux-homedir:

Homedir
-------

Regardless of whether you are using the **box** directly as ``root``, or using the
``odus`` user, then setup the ``$HOME`` directory like so:

.. code-block:: bash

  mkdir $HOME/{artifacts,git,workdirs,guests,images}

The directories are used for the following:

**git**
  A place to store source-repositories, usually these are git repositories for
  projects like: xnvme, fio, spdk, linux, and qemu.

**workdirs**
  A place for auxilary files, when executing **cijoe** workflows, or doing
  misc. experiments and exploration.

**artifacts**
  A place to store intermediate artifacts during development. Such as adhoc
  Linux kernel ``.deb`` packages, source-archives etc.

**guests**
  A place where boot-images, pid-files, cloud-seeds and other files related to
  qemu guests live.

**images**
  A place to store VM "boot-images", such as cloud-init enabled images.

.. _sec-tutorials-devs-linux-screen:

Screen + http.server
--------------------

Regardless of whether your **devbox** is physical/virtual/local/remote or some
combination thereof. Then having access to misc. files, and specifically, to
things like **cijoe** output / reports. Is very convenient.

With minimal fuss, then this is achievable with a combinaion of ``screen`` and
Python:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd ~/workdirs
  screen -d -m python3 -m http.server

The above starts a webserver, serving the content of the ``cwd`` where
``python3`` is executed and served up over ``tcp/http`` on port **8000**.

The ``screen -d -m`` part, creates a screen-session and detaches from it. Thus,
it continues executing even if you disconnect.

You can see the running screen-sessions with:

.. code-block:: bash

  screen -list

And attach to them using their ``<name>``:

.. code-block:: bash

  screen -r <name>

.. _sec-tutorials-devs-linux-cijoe:

xNVMe
-----

Clone, build, and install **xNVMe** and checkout the ``next`` branch:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd ~/git
  git clone https://github.com/OpenMPDK/xNVMe.git xnvme
  cd xnvme
  git checkout next

Install prerequisites:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo ./toolbox/pkgs/debian-bookworm.sh

Build and install **xNVMe**:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd ~/git/xnvme
  make
  sudo make install

Check that it is functional:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo xnvme enum

This should yield output similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

  xnvme_cli_enumeration:
  - {uri: '/dev/nvme0n1', dtype: 0x2, nsid: 0x1, csi: 0x0, subnqn: ''}

cijoe
-----

Setup by running the following in the root of the **xNVMe** repository:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd ~/git/xnvme
  make cijoe

This will install **cijoe** along with a couple of **cijoe-packages** for
Linux, qemu, and fio. After installation, then a configuation file is added at
``~/.config/cijoe/cijoe-config.toml``. You need to adjust this to match your
system, look specifically for these entries:

.. code-block:: bash

  [qemu]
  # system_bin = "{{ local.env.HOME }}/opt/qemu/bin/qemu-system-aarch64"
  system_bin = "/opt/qemu/bin/qemu-system-aarch64"
  img_bin = "qemu-img"
  default_guest = "bookworm_arm64"

  [xnvme.repository]
  upstream = "https://github.com/OpenMPDK/xNVMe.git"
  path = "{{ local.env.HOME }}/git/xnvme"

  # This is utilized by repository syncing during development.
  [xnvme.repository.sync]
  branch = "wip"
  remote = "guest"
  remote_path = "/root/git/xnvme"

In general, ensure paths to repositories, binaries, etc. match your local system
and the remote system you are using.

Then logout and back in to reload the environment, the addition of ``pipx`` and
the ``cijoe`` into ``$PATH``.

Do a trial-run:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Create a workdir
  mkdir -p ~/workdirs/cijoe
  cd ~/workdirs/cijoe

  # Create a default configuration and workflow
  cijoe --example core

In case everything is fine, then it will execute silently.

You can increase the information-level with ``-l``
argument, the more times you provide the higher the level.
Try running it with two, that is debug-level:

.. code-block:: bash

  cijoe -ll

In the ``cwd`` then a ``cijoe-output`` is produced, this
directory holds all information about what was executed.
Have a look at the generated report at
``cijoe-output/report.html``.

.. note::
   In case you see failures, then inspect the ``RUNLOG`` in the report, this
   usually tells you exactly what went wrong.

.. note::
   Make sure that ``pytest`` is not installed system-wide by running ``which
   pytest``. In case it says ``/usr/bin/pytest``, then it is not using the
   ``pytest`` provided with the **CIJOE** module. Thus, uninstall it using
   ``apt-get remove python3-pytest``.

Artifacts
~~~~~~~~~

Produce a set of **artifacts**:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd ~/git/xnvme
  make clobber gen-artifacts

  # Keep them handy if need be
  cp -r /tmp/artifacts ~/artifacts/xnvme

.. warning::
   The ``make clobber`` removes any unstaged changes and removes subprojects.
   This is done to ensure an entirely "clean" repository. Thus, make sure that
   you have commit your changes.
   The ``make clobber`` is required for ``make gen-artifacts``, as it will
   otherwise include side-effects from previous builds.

.. note::
   The artifacts produces by ``make gen-artifacts`` are output to
   ``/tmp/artifacts``. There are **cijoe** workflows, expecting to be available
   at that location, specifically the **provision** workflow.

.. _sec-tutorials-devs-linux-customkernel:

Linux Kernel
------------

Install prerequisites:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Essentials for building the kernel
  sudo apt-get -qy install \
    bc \
    bison \
    build-essential \
    debhelper \
    flex \
    git \
    libelf-dev \
    libssl-dev \
    pahole \
    rsync

  # A couple of extra libraries and tools
  sudo apt-get -qy install \
    libncurses-dev \
    linux-cpupower \
    python3-cpuinfo

.. note::
   ``libnurses-dev`` is needed for ``make menuconfig``. ``linux-cpupower``
   provides a cli-tool ``cpupower`` that let's you control the Linux CPU
   governor, useful for performance evaluation.

Then run the **cijoe** workflow, compiling a custom kernel as a ``.deb``
package:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Create a workdir for the workflow
  mkdir -p ~/workdirs/linux
  cd ~/workdirs/linux

  # Grab the cijoe-example for linux
  cijoe --example linux

  # Run it with logging (-l)
  cijoe -l

Then re-run the command above. It should now succeed, after which you can
collect the artifacts of interest:

.. code-block:: bash

  cp -r cijoe-output/artifacts/linux ~/artifacts/

You can install them by running:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo dpkg -i ~/artifacts/linux/*.deb

.. _sec-tutorials-devs-linux-qemu:

Qemu
----

Install prerequisites:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Packages for building qemu
  sudo apt-get -qy install \
    meson \
    libattr1-dev \
    libcap-ng-dev \
    libglib2.0-dev \
    libpixman-1-dev \
    libslirp-dev \
    pkg-config

  # Packages for cloud-init
  sudo apt-get -qy install \
    cloud-image-utils

Checkout qemu:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd ~/git
  git clone https://github.com/OpenMPDK/qemu --recursive
  cd qemu
  git checkout for-xnvme
  git submodule update --init --recursive

Create a work-directory:

.. code-block:: bash

  mkdir -p ~/workdirs/qemu
  cd ~/workdirs/qemu

Run the **cijoe** qemu workflow:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Grab the config and workflow example for qemu
  cijoe --example qemu

  # Run it with log-level debug (-l)
  cijoe -l

With the packages installed, go back and run the **cijoe** workflow. Have a look
at the report, it describes what it does, that is, build and install qemu, spin
up a vm using a cloud-init-enabled Debian image, ssh into it.

.. tip::
   In case you get errors such as::

     Could not access KVM kernel module: No such file or directory
     qemu-system-x86_64: failed to initialize kvm: No such file or directory

   Then this is usually a symptom of virtualization being
   disabled in the BIOS of the physical machine. Have a look
   at ``dmesg`` it might proide messages supporting this.

Setup qemu-guest / virtual machine for testing
----------------------------------------------

Now that you have qemu built and installed. You can use it to emulate NVMe
devices in the guest for testing. The **xNVMe** ``Makefile`` has a bunch of
helper-targets to do this. That is, spinning up the guest, synchronizing your
**xNVMe** git repository changes into the qemu-guest, building, installing, and
running tests.

Test Linux
~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

  # Create a cijoe-config for a qemu-guest with Debian Bullseye
  cp cijoe/configs/debian-bullseye.toml ~/.config/cijoe/cijoe-config.toml

  # Provision the machine
  make cijoe-guest-setup-xnvme-using-git

  # Run the test
  make cijoe-do-test-linux

Generate documentation in Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can reuse qemu-guest created in the previous section to generate the
documentation.

.. code-block:: bash

  make cijoe-do-docgen

Test FreeBSD
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

  # Create a cijoe-config for a qemu-guest with FreeBSD
  cp cijoe/configs/debian-bullseye.toml ~/.config/cijoe/cijoe-config.toml

  # Provision the machine
  make cijoe-guest-setup-xnvme-using-git

  # Run the test
  make cijoe-do-test-freebsd
  

Reproduce GitHUB Actions locally
--------------------------------

The **cijoe** workflows and configurations in this directory are used in the
xNVMe GitHUB actions. You can reproduce what is running on GitHUB by adjusting
the config-files, and provide the artifacts from the GitHUB action:

* xnvme-py-sdist.tar.gz
* xnvme-src.tar.gz

Then, place the artifacts in ``/tmp/artifacts``.

Test Linux
~~~~~~~~~~

Then you should be able to run the following to test **Linux**:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Provision and test on Debian Bullseye
  cp cijoe/configs/debian-bullseye.toml ~/.config/cijoe/cijoe-config.toml
  # Edit the cijoe-config, then run

  make cijoe-guest-setup-using-tgz
  make cijoe-do-test-linux

Test FreeBSD
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then you should be able to run the following to test xNVMe on **FreeBSD**:
  
.. code-block:: bash

  # Provision and test on FreeBSD 13
  cp cijoe/configs/freebsd-13.toml ~/.config/cijoe/cijoe-config.toml

  make cijoe-guest-setup-using-tgz
  make cijoe-do-test-freebsd

Generate docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

And generate documentation:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Generate documentation (provisions qemu-guest and generates the docs)
  make cijoe-do-docgen

In case you are setting up the test-target using other tools, or just want to
run pytest directly, then the following two sections describe how to do that.

Running pytest from the repository
----------------------------------

Invoke pytest providing a configuration file and an output directory for
artifacts and captured output:

.. code-block:: bash

  pytest \
    --config configs/debian-bullseye.toml \
    --output /tmp/somewhere \
   tests

The ``--config`` is needed to inform pytest about the environment you are
running in such as which devices it can use for testing. The information is
utilized by pytest to, among other things, do parametrization for xNVMe backend
configurations etc.

Provision a qemu-guest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setup a virtual machine with **xNVMe** installed, and a bunch of NVMe devices
configured:

.. code-block:: bash

  cijoe -c configs/debian-bullseye.toml -w provision.yaml

.. tip::
   It will likely fail with the error::

     /bin/sh: 1: /opt/qemu/bin/qemu-system-x86_64: not found

   This is because the default configuration is for running on Github. Thus,
   adjust the file ``configs/debian-bullseye.toml`` such that qemu is
   pointing to ``$HOME``.

Create boot-images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``debian-bullseye-amd64.qcow2`` is created by:

.. code-block:: bash

  cijoe -c configs/debian-bullseye.toml -w workflows/bootimg-debian-bullseye-amd64.yaml

The ``freebsd-13.1-ksrc-amd64.qcow2`` is created by:

.. code-block:: bash

  cijoe -c configs/freebsd-13.toml -w workflows/bootimg-freebsd-13-amd64.yaml

Remote dev
----------

Assuming your primary device for development is something like a Chromebook/
Macbook, something light-weight and great for reading mail... but now you want
to fire up your editor and do some development.

Or, your primary system is simply separate from the dev-box for a myriad of
reasons. Then, have a look at the existing **cijoe** configuration files in
``cijoe/configs/*.toml``, copy one that mathes your intended system, e.g.
use the configuration file for the qemu-guest as a starting point for a
configuration file for another physical machine:

.. code-block:: bash

  cp configs/debian-bullseye.toml ~/.config/cijoe/cijoe-config.toml

Open up ``~/.config/cijoe/cijoe-config.toml`` and adjust it to your physical
machine. That is, change the ssh-login information, change the list of devices,
paths to binaries etc. Once you have done that, then go ahead and run:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Synchronize your local git with the repos on the remote physical machine
  make cijoe-sync-git

  # Build and install xNVMe on the remote end
  make cijoe-setup-xnvme-using-git

You can do any of the **cijoe** things like the above.
