# uPCIe CUDA

```{warning}
This backend requires a custom Linux kernel patch that is not yet upstream.
See {ref}`sec-backends-upcie-cuda-kernel` for details.
```

The **upcie-cuda** backend enables direct **PCIe peer-to-peer (P2P)** data
transfers between the NVMe device and the GPU, with I/O buffers allocated from
a heap backed by **CUDA device memory**.

Physical addresses for GPU memory are resolved once at initialization through
the Linux `dma-buf` interface. The CUDA driver exports memory at 64 KiB
granularity (one dma-buf page per 64 KiB of GPU memory), and these physical
addresses are stored in a lookup table (LUT) indexed by GPU page. At
submission time, PRP entries are built at **4 KiB granularity** by computing
sub-page offsets within each 64 KiB LUT entry. This matches the host page
size used by NVMe for PRP construction and sector alignment.

## Memory Architecture

This backend uses a **hybrid memory model**:

| Structure | Location | Reason |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Data buffers (`xnvme_buf_alloc`) | GPU device memory (CUDA heap, 1 GiB) | Transferred directly by the NVMe controller via PCIe P2P, bypassing host DRAM |
| SQ, CQ, PRP lists | Host hugepage memory (host heap, 256 MiB) | The CPU writes and the NVMe controller DMA-reads these structures; host-accessible memory is required |

The NVMe **data** path goes GPU ↔ NVMe without touching host DRAM. The
**control** path (submission queue entries, completion queue entries, PRP lists)
still flows through host memory. As a result, both the CUDA heap and the host
hugepage runtime are initialized when the first **upcie-cuda** device is opened.

## Kernel Requirement

Physical address resolution for CUDA device memory relies on importing a
`dma-buf` exported by the CUDA driver into the kernel's DMA subsystem. This
requires a Linux kernel patch that is not yet upstream:

- [xnvme/udmabuf-import](https://github.com/xnvme/udmabuf-import)

Build and install that patched kernel before using the **upcie-cuda** backend.

## System Configuration

### Hardware Requirements

P2P transfers require a GPU with a sufficiently large **BAR1** window. BAR1
maps GPU device memory into the host PCIe address space and must be large
enough to cover the CUDA heap (1 GiB by default). To check the available BAR1
size:

```bash
nvidia-smi -q -d memory
```

Look for the `BAR1 Memory Usage` section. If `Total` BAR1 is smaller than the
heap size, initialization will fail.

### Hugepages

In addition to the CUDA heap, opening an **upcie-cuda** device also initializes
the host hugepage runtime (256 MiB) used to hold NVMe control structures. Follow
the hugepage setup steps in {ref}`sec-backends-upcie-host` before opening an
**upcie-cuda** device.

## GPU-Resident Queue API

The **upcie-cuda** backend supports GPU-resident NVMe queue pairs via the
`libxnvme_cuda` API. See {ref}`sec-api-c-gpu` for the full API reference,
including host-side setup, CUDA kernel dispatch, and queue depth semantics.

## Validation

The cijoe workflow ``test-gpu.yaml`` exercises the **upcie-cuda** backend
against a PCIe NVMe device. Devices must be tagged with the ``cuda`` label in
your cijoe configuration:

```toml
[[devices]]
uri = "0000:xx:00.0"
nsid = 1
labels = ["dev", "pcie", "nvm", "cuda"]
driver_attachment = "userspace"
```

Run the workflow with:

```bash
cd cijoe && cijoe workflows/test-gpu.yaml --config configs/<your-config>.toml
```

## Limitations

- **GPU 0 only.** The CUDA context and heap are always created on CUDA device
  0. Multiple GPU support is not implemented.
- **1 GiB heap.** The CUDA heap is fixed at 1 GiB. Allocations beyond this
  limit return `ENOMEM`.
- **No PRP list chaining.** Each request has a single 4 KiB PRP list page
  (512 entries). Combined with PRP1, the maximum transfer size per command
  is 513 × 4 KiB ≈ 2 MiB.
- **No `buf_realloc`.** Buffer reallocation is not implemented and returns
  `ENOSYS`.
- **No memory mapping** (`mem_map` / `mem_unmap`). These return `ENOSYS`.
- **No pseudo commands.** Show registers, controller reset, subsystem reset,
  and namespace rescan all return `ENOSYS`.
