 Getting Started
=================

Previously a **quick start** guide was available. However, it usually left one
asking questions, and thus, did not as the name suggests; get you started
quickly. Thus, a fuller story on getting started using **xNVMe** is provided
here.  Needlessly, this section will have subsections that you can skip and
revisit only in case you find **xNVMe**, or the system you are running on, to
be misbehaving.

If you have read through, and still have questions, then
please raise an :xref-github-xnvme-issues:`issue<>`, start an
asynchronous :xref-github-xnvme-discussions:`discussions<>`, or go
to :xref-discord-xnvme:`Discord<>` for synchronous interaction.

The task of getting started with **xNVMe** will take you through
:ref:`sec-gs-building` with a companion section on :ref:`sec-building-toolchain`
prerequisites, followed by a section describing runtime requirements in
:ref:`sec-gs-system-config`, ending with an example of
:ref:`sec-gs-building-example`.
