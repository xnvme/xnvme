# hatches as there are colours. When creating plots, we can
# use the same colours multiple times with different markers
# and hatches.

- "#511849"   # purple
- "#03BAAD"   # turquoise
- "#FF5733"   # red orange
- "#3D3D6B"   # dark blue

markers:
- "o"   # large circle
- "s"   # square
- "D"   # diamond
- "*"   # star
- "X"   # cross
- "p"   # pentagon
- "P"   # plus

hatches:
- "/"   # diagonal stripes positive
- "."   # dots
- "x"   # diagonal grid
- "O"   # large circles
- "\\"   # diagonal stripes negative
- "-"   # horizontal lines
