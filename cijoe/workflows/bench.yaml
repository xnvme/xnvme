  Environment prep, benchmark run, result plotting, and report gen.
  =================================================================

  Environment preparation consists of

  * Retrieving and updating repositories for liburing, xnvme, fio, and SPDK
  * Configure, build and install liburing, xnvme, fio, and SPDK
  * Generate bdev-configs for all CIJOE "duts"

  The comparison and plots consists of

    * bandwidth in KiB / seconds
    * latency is mean and in nano-seconds
    * IOPS are 'raw' / base-unit

  The above in a bar-plot at iodepth=1, and a line-plot as a function of iodepth.

  See Artifacts for the generated plots
