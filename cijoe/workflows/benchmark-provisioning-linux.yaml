  Environment prep for Linux
  =================================================================

  Environment preparation consists of

  * Retrieving and updating repositories for liburing, xnvme, fio, and SPDK
  * Configure, build and install liburing, xnvme, fio, and SPDK
  * Generate bdev-configs for all CIJOE "duts"

steps:

- name: sysinfo
  uses: linux.sysinfo

- name: hardware
  run: lshw

- name: repository
  uses: core.repository_prep

- name: liburing
  uses: liburing_build

- name: xnvme_build
  uses: xnvme_build

- name: xnvme_install
  uses: xnvme_install

- name: ldconfig
  run: ldconfig

- name: fio
  uses: fio_prep

- name: spdk
  uses: spdk_build_modded

- name: bdev_confs
  uses: spdk_bdev_confs_generator
  with:
    bdev_confs: /opt/bdev_confs

- name: prep
  run: |
    xnvme-driver || true
    xnvme-driver reset || true

# This is needed whenever io_uring and io_uring_cmd is used, hmm, bdevperf will
# probably need something special here...
