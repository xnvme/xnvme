  Test xNVMe using the ramdisk backend (on MacOS)

  Configuration
  =============

  * The tests utilize fio and thus the configuration must point to where custom fio is located
  * The test **should** otherwise run without any system dependencies as they only utilize the
    "ramdisk" backend

steps:
- name: test_linkandload
  uses: core.testrunner
  with:
    args: '-k linkandload tests'

- name: test_ramdisk
  uses: core.testrunner
  with:
    args: '-k "ramdisk and not hugepage and not compare or xnvme_library_info" tests'
